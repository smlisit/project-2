		Introducing my new collaboration with Seattle-based drinkware company, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/MiiR/">@MiiR</a>. This collection aims to showcase pieces of functional beauty which speak to the resilience and strength our global community has shown while battling an unprecedented pandemic. <br><br>
		Inspired by the Japanese concept of Gaman (我慢), translated as “enduring the seemingly unbearable with patience and dignity,” we have created a suite of custom products which help support <a href="https://www.instagram.com/preemptivelove/">@preemptivelove</a>, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting those most vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. As a long-time friend & supporter of Preemptive Love and their incredible work, this is something I’m truly excited about.<br><br>
		For every #MiiRxTanamachi Collection product sold, $5 goes directly to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/preemptivelove/">@preemptivelove</a> and their work around the world. To learn more and/or pre-order, please visit <a href="miir.com/tanamachi">miir.com/tanamachi</a>.
