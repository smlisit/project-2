	<h2>Starbucks San Francisco Mural</h2>
	<p>
	Cross-post from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BpmWQ8qA5OY/">Instagram</a><br><br>

	Earlier this year, I was honored to design and install this giant mural for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/starbucks/">@starbucks</a> in San Francisco—at the end of Maiden Lane on Kearny Street, near Union Square.<br><br>

	The concept behind this piece was to illustrate the Starbucks Siren as “The Maiden of Maiden Lane”—a wild and benevolent Lady Liberty of the West Coast, welcoming those from afar and paying homage to the nautical history of San Francisco. She is surrounded by diverse, native California flora which represents the coming together of many cultures.<br><br>

	It was by far my largest hand-painted piece to date, measuring in at around 16'x36' and taking six days to install (on three levels of scaffolding!). I couldn't have done it without my incredible crew: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hillerypowers/">@hillerypowers</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tararudolph_/">@tararudolph_</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/allthingsmeng/">@allthingsmeng</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/okayjeffrey/">@okayjeffrey</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/keltroughton/">@keltroughton</a>.
