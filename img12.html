		<h2>Thank You USPS Stamp</h2>

		Time to make your mail ✨SHINE✨. My new ‘Thank You’ stamp with the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uspostalservice/">@uspostalservice</a> is available for pre-order at USPS.com/stamps—and it officially releases next Friday! It comes in a set of four jewel tone colors, And YES, that is gold foil!<br><br>
		I’ve been sitting on this for over five years, y’all. I designed this stamp back in 2015 and wondered if it would ever see the light of day. But, I wouldn’t change a thing. Who ever imagined that buying postage in 2020 would become a form of activism? We need to do our part to save the USPS now. So, I’m gonna need you to pre-order this baby IN BULK, k?<br><br>
		FYI, The USPS receives no tax dollars for operating expenses. It relies on the sale of postage, products, and services to fund its operations. Head to USPS.com/stamps to preorder. And buy some for a friend! And while you’re at it, pick up some gorgeous <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ruthasawaofficial/">@ruthasawaofficial</a> stamps, too. It’s a hell of a month (philatelically speaking) for female Japanese-American artists!
