	<h2>National Book Festival Poster</h2>

	<p>
	Cross-post from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSXbpYeHD2g/">Instagram</a><br><br>
	It was a huge honor to create the poster for this year's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/librarycongress/">@librarycongress</a> National Book Festival! When I began considering all the imagery involved in a book festival, I started with most obvious—actual books! It dawned on me that an open book could also look like a blossoming flower, and the ideas started to flow instantly.<br><br>
	I envisioned a wild garden, like something out of Alice in Wonderland or Jack and the Beanstalk, with blooming books that could transport readers to alternate worlds. It was these worlds that inspired me to add the stars and ombré sky—to convey a sense of vastness, wonder, adventure, and exploration. Books and flowers both open up and invite us in to behold beauty, mark the seasons, and experience change and growth. Happy reading!
