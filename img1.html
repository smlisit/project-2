		*SNEAK PEEK* I've spent the last year collaborating with the iconic & inimitable <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michi_kakutani/">@michi_kakutani</a> on her latest book, titled "Ex Libris: 100+ Books to Read and Reread"—published by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/clarksonpotter/">@clarksonpotter</a>, releasing NEXT WEEK on October 20th.<br><br>
		As the former New York Times Chief Book Critic for over 30 years (!!!), Michiko has read it all. And Ex Libris is her definitive list of must-read books—a book-lover's Bible, if you will. I had the honor of creating 30 full-page illustrations for individual titles, all in the style of vintage bookplates. Not to mention the exterior, end papers, and all that jazz! I'm excited to share these colorful and whimsical drawings with you, so stay tuned.<br><br>
		Available for pre-order everywhere books are sold, and at the link in my bio!</p>
