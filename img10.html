		2018⠀<br>
		A fan is at its most beautiful and most useful when fully open.⁣⠀<br><br>
		I started these fans in 2017 and finally finished them late last year. I created them entirely from scratch—designed the blade shape in Illustrator, had them laser cut out of wood, then glued the blades together. I used acrylic to paint the base gradients and black linework. I wanted these to feel very freeform and organic and was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/suminagashi/">#Suminagashi</a> —scanning and incorporating some actual marbling samples that I had made just weeks earlier at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/japansociety_nyc/">@japansociety_nyc</a>. Happy with how these turned out!
